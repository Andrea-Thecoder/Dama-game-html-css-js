The game of checkers: Task assigned as part of the challenge commissioned by our training course (Labfortraining) during the month of March. The task involved creating the game of checkers using the drag-and-drop technique, with the following victory conditions: the first to crown a piece wins. The player who runs out of pieces loses. If time runs out, the game ends in a draw.

This was my first group project. I focused almost exclusively on the logic (JavaScript), while my partner mainly handled the CSS. Of course, there was great collaboration as we helped each other whenever we encountered a problem. It was an excellent teamworking experience!

The challenge lasted 60 days, and we delivered the game in 32 days, perfectly functional and meeting all the required tasks!

We won first place in the challenge with this project.
